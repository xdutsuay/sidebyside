**Model:** `llama3.2:latest`
**Rating:** 6/10
**Tags:** Sorting, Algorithm, Data Structure
**Quiz:** What is the purpose of the `swapped` boolean variable in the inner loop of the bubble sort algorithm?
**Feedback:** This implementation has a good structure but lacks optimization for large datasets. It's also worth noting that C++ provides built-in sorting algorithms like `std::sort`, which can be more efficient and convenient to use.
