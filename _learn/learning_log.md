**Rating:** 6/10
**Tags:** Sorting, Algorithm, Data Structure
**Quiz:** What is the purpose of the `swapped` boolean variable in the inner loop of the bubble sort algorithm?
**Feedback:** This implementation has a good structure but lacks optimization for large datasets. It's also worth noting that C++ provides built-in sorting algorithms like `std::sort`, which can be more efficient and convenient to use.

**Rating:** 8/10
**Tags:** Sorting, Algorithm, Recursive
**Quiz:** What is the main difference between the "left less than or equal" and "right greater than or equal" partitioning approaches in quicksort?

**Feedback:** This implementation is a solid start, but there's room for improvement. Consider adding more comments to explain the logic behind the partition function, as well as some input validation to ensure the recursive calls are made correctly.

**Model:** `llama3.2:latest`
**Rating:** 8/10
**Tags:** Binary Search, Algorithmic Efficiency, Array Manipulation
**Quiz:** What will be the output of the binary_search function when the input array is {2, 3, 4, 10, 40} and the target value is 25? 

**Feedback:** The implementation looks clean and well-structured. However, the use of magic numbers (e.g., `arr.size() - 1`) could be improved by defining named constants for better readability.
